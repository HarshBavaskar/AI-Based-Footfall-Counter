A high-accuracy **footfall counting system** that uses **YOLOv8** and **DeepSORT** for detecting and tracking people across a defined ROI line.
It automatically classifies movements as **entries** or **exits**, giving precise insights for analytics and crowd monitoring.

## 🧠 Overview

This system leverages modern AI-based vision techniques for real-time **people tracking and counting** in video footage.
It’s designed for scalability and integration in:

* 🏬 Retail Analytics (shopper insights)
* 🏢 Smart Buildings (occupancy control)
* 🎟️ Events & Venues (capacity tracking)
* 🚇 Public Transport Stations (crowd flow)
* 🧠 Research & Urban Planning

## ⚙️ Key Features

✅ **Real-Time YOLOv8 Detection**
✅ **DeepSORT Multi-Object Tracking**
✅ **Accurate Entry/Exit Counting**
✅ **Customizable ROI Line**
✅ **Auto-Saving Annotated Videos**
✅ **Quick Run via run.bat**

## 🧩 Installation

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/footfall-counter-ai.git
cd footfall-counter-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install ultralytics deep-sort-realtime opencv-python numpy
```

---

## ▶️ Quick Start (Windows)

To start instantly, double-click **`run.bat`** in the project folder.

Or run manually:

```bash
python footfall_counter.py
```

By default:

* Model: `yolov8n.pt`
* Input: `test_video.mp4`
* Output: `output_video.mp4`

---

## ⚙️ Custom Usage (Python)

```python
from footfall_counter import FootfallCounter

counter = FootfallCounter(
    model_path='yolov8s.pt',    # Choose any YOLOv8 variant
    roi_line_y=350,             # Adjust counting line position
    confidence_threshold=0.5
)

counter.process_video('mall_video.mp4', 'mall_output.mp4')
```

---

## 📈 Output Example

Each processed frame displays:

* Bounding boxes with **unique IDs**
* **Entry (🟢)** and **Exit (🔴)** counters
* A **counting line** overlay
* **Total movement statistics**
